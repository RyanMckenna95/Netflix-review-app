# Netflix-review-app

**Student name: Ryan Mckenna**



This app is to allow users the write review for content available on netflix. It allows users to write reviews and score them between 1 and 10.

I use a realm database to give persistence to my user saved reviews. I have now updated it to a firebase database for its reviews.

i have also changed the search feature to search the themoviedb API's movies. And created a details section for when an movie in the trending list is clicked.
